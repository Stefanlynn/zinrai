You acknowledge and agree that it is Your responsibility to ensure the Payment Method remains valid at all times during Your Membership, and that You will provide to ZiNRAi all information necessary to allow Us to charge the Payment Method (or any valid, replacement credit or debit card) for all amounts due and payable by You to us.

If You pay using a digital currency, Your payment may be processed by Our affiliate, Assiduous Inc., on Our behalf.</p>

          <p>To the extent permitted by law We reserve the right to apply reasonable account maintenance fees and to charge these to Your Payment Method. We will advise You in advance of introducing any such charges by notice in writing.</p>

          <div className="bg-red-900/20 border border-red-500/30 p-6 rounded-lg">
            <p className="font-bold uppercase mb-4">READ THESE DISPUTE RESOLUTION TERMS CAREFULLY. THEY SUPERSEDE AND REPLACE ALL PRIOR TERMS FOR RESOLVING DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND ZiNRAi, REQUIRE YOU AND ZiNRAi TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN CLAIMS ("CLAIM(S)", AND LIMIT HOW YOU AND ZiNRAi CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM EACH OTHER. WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS, THESE TERMS PRECLUDE YOU AND ZiNRAi FROM SUING IN COURT OR PARTICIPATING IN A CLASS ACTION AND YOU AND ZiNRAi AGREE THAT ARBITRATION WILL BE SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A CLASS ARBITRATION, CLASS ACTION, OR ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. YOU AND ZiNRAi ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY A JURY. FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW IN SECTION L IF YOU WISH TO OPT OUT OF THE REQUIREMENT TO ARBITRATE.</p>
          </div>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 text-blue-300">A. Arbitration Agreement</h3>
          <p>THE PARTIES TO THESE MEMBER TERMS AND CONDITIONS MUTUALLY AGREE THAT ANY CLAIM OR DISPUTE BETWEEN THEM ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THESE MEMBER TERMS AND CONDITIONS OR THE RIGHTS OF THE PARTIES UNDER THESE MEMBER TERMS AND CONDITIONS WHICH CANNOT BE RESOLVED BY INFORMAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION SHALL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION BEFORE A SINGLE ARBITRATOR ADMINISTERED BY THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION ("AAA"). The rules applicable to Claims between You and ZiNRAi shall be AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules. The Consumer Arbitration Rules of the AAA are available at www.adr.org.</p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 text-blue-300">B. Alternative Arbitration</h3>
          <p>In the event the AAA is unwilling or unable to hear the dispute, the Parties shall agree to, or an appropriate court shall select, another arbitration provider. Unless otherwise agreed upon by the Parties, any arbitration hearing shall take place in Sheridan, Wyoming, although either party may elect to participate in the arbitration by telephone. The Party filing the Demand for Arbitration shall be responsible for the initial filing fees and costs charged by AAA and the respondent shall be responsible for payment of filing fees for any Cross-Complaint or Counterclaim.</p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 text-blue-300">C. Third Party Beneficiaries</h3>
          <p>Although this agreement to arbitrate is made and entered into between You and ZiNRAi, ZiNRAi's affiliates, owners, members, managers, and employees ("Related Parties") are intended third party beneficiaries of the Member Terms and Conditions including this agreement to arbitrate.</p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 text-blue-300">D. Survival and Process</h3>
          <p>This agreement to arbitrate shall survive the termination of the Membership and the Member's ZiNRAi account. Any issues related to the arbitrability of any claim, or the scope, validity or enforceability of this agreement to arbitrate shall be determined by the arbitrator. If either party wishes to initiate arbitration, the initiating party must notify the other party in writing via certified mail, return receipt requested, or hand delivery via courier. The Demand for Arbitration must include a statement of the legal and factual basis of the claim(s) to be arbitrated. You will send a copy of any demand for arbitration to ZiNRAi by certified mail addressed to ZiNRAi, LLC, 30 Gould Street, Sheridan Wyoming 82801. ZiNRAi will send any demand for arbitration to You by certified mail using the current mailing address You provided in Your ZiNRAi Member enrollment or in Your Member profile, if updated. The parties shall be entitled to all discovery rights permitted by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the parties shall be permitted to bring motions under FRCP Rules 12 and 56. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on the parties and may, if necessary, be reduced to a final judgment in a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 text-blue-300">E. Required Informal Dispute Resolution</h3>
          <p>Except for IP Claims (defined in Section F) and Claims requiring a temporary restraining order, if either of Us has a Claim against the other, both of Us must first attempt to resolve the Claim informally before the Claim may be brought in arbitration. You and ZiNRAi will make a good-faith effort to negotiate for forty-five (45) days towards the resolution of any Claim, or for a longer period as mutually agreed in writing by You and ZiNRAi. You will send any Claimant Notice to ZiNRAi by certified mail addressed to ZiNRAi, LLC, 30 Gould Street, Sheridan Wyoming 82801. ZiNRAi will send any Claimant Notice to You by certified mail using the current mailing address You provided in Your ZiNRAi Member profile. The Claimant Notice sent by either party must provide factual information sufficient for the receiving party to evaluate the Claim and must include the claimant's name, address, email address, and any relevant purchase information and product information. Engaging in Informal Dispute Resolution is a condition precedent to either party's right to initiate an arbitration.</p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 text-blue-300">F. Claims Subject to Binding Arbitration; Exceptions</h3>
          <p>Except for IP Claims, which are disputes that exclusively relate to infringement of Your or ZiNRAi's intellectual property rights, both parties agree that all Claims meeting the requirements of Section E that are not resolved during the Informal Resolution Period, including Claims that are unrelated to IP Claims but are jointly filed with IP Claims, will only be resolved through binding arbitration.</p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 text-blue-300">G. Small Claims</h3>
          <p>You or ZiNRAi may pursue any Claim, except IP Claims, in a small-claims court instead of through arbitration if (i) the Claim meets the jurisdictional requirements of the small claims court and (ii) the small claims court does not permit class actions or similar representative actions or relief.</p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 text-blue-300">H. Arbitration Fees</h3>
          <p>You and ZiNRAi will each be responsible for paying the fees of the arbitrator and any administrative fees charged by AAA according to the rules and procedures of the AAA.</p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 text-blue-300">I. Frivolous or Improper Claims</h3>
          <p>To the extent permitted by law, a claimant must pay all reasonable costs and fees incurred by the responding party—including arbitration fees, attorney fees, and expert fees—related to a Claim if an arbitrator or court determines that (i) the Claim was not warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument or (ii) the Claim was filed in arbitration for any improper purpose, including to harass the responding party, cause unnecessary delay, or increase the cost of dispute resolution.</p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 text-red-300">J. Class Action Waiver</h3>
          <div className="bg-red-900/20 border border-red-500/30 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p>You and ZiNRAi agree that by entering into the above agreement to arbitrate both parties are waiving their right to have any dispute or claim brought, heard or arbitrated as a class action lawsuit or class action arbitration, or any joint or consolidated lawsuit or joint or consolidated arbitration of any kind. You and ZiNRAi agree that an arbitrator shall not have any authority to hear or arbitrate any class or collective action. You and ZiNRAi agree that any claim that all or part of this class action waiver is unenforceable shall be determined by a state or federal court located in Sheridan, Wyoming and not by an arbitrator. You and ZiNRAi further agree that if a court determines that the limitations of this paragraph are deemed invalid or unenforceable, any putative class or representative action must be brought in a court of proper jurisdiction and not in arbitration.</p>
          </div>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 text-blue-300">K. Mass Arbitrations</h3>
          <p>If twenty-five (25) or more Claimant Notices are received by a party within one hundred and eighty (180) days of the first Claimant Notice that the party received, and all such Claimant Notices raise similar Claims and have the same or coordinated counsel, then these Claims will be considered "Mass Arbitrations." You or ZiNRAi may advise the other if You or ZiNRAi believe that the Claims at issue are Mass Arbitrations, and disputes over whether a Claim meets the definition of "Mass Arbitrations" will be decided by the arbitration provider as an administrative matter. Mass Arbitrations shall proceed pursuant to the AAA Mass Arbitration procedures.</p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 text-blue-300">L. 30-Day Right to Opt Out</h3>
          <div className="bg-yellow-900/20 border border-yellow-500/30 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p className="font-bold text-yellow-300 mb-2">Important: Right to Opt Out</p>
            <p>You have the right to opt out of arbitration by sending written notice of Your decision to opt out to the following address by mail: ZiNRAi, LLC, 30 Gould Street, Sheridan Wyoming 82801 within thirty (30) days of You first becoming subject to these Dispute Resolution Terms. Such notice must include the name of each person opting out and contact information for each such person, the specific products, or services used that are at issue, the email address that You used to set up Your ZiNRAi account (if You have one), and, if applicable, a copy of Your purchase receipt(s).</p>
          </div>
